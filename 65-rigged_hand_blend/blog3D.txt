when i started working on the 3d model for representing hands in the website to show signs, initially i downloaded a rigged hand 3d model from web.
but then i added my custom bones. and then learnt how to connect each bones, i.e. parenting them.
now i am able to make poses with this hand in the blender pose mode. but i had to work my way to manipulate the model using scripting.
initially am trying to do so using scripting default enabled in blender.
trying to understand how bone location is adjusted. then tried to use something called Inverse Kinematics but it didn't work as expect, unaware of what's actually wrong with it.
so now thinking to work on the directly moving hand using bones. but i need to understand behaviour of bone when it is given co-ordinates in parent attached and independent. in independent it shifts the location of bone to the lower end of bone.
we cant move the child bone without moving parent bone.
so i took a new approach by just making angles between bones.
in this we need to find angels between points found in the media pipe output, then input those angles to here for the respective bones in model.
worked on the python code with mediapipe model such that it can take image input and convert img into landmarks points
then need to make work on getting angles from it
